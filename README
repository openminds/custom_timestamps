CustomTimestamps
================

Some legacy databases have already defined their own created_at or updated_at fields. They can be easily filled in with ActiveRecord before_save filters, but changing this should be trivial. This plugin enables you to set your own column names for these timestamps

Example
=======

class LegacyModel < ActiveRecord::Base
  set_create_column :creation_time
  set_update_column :change_time
end
